# version [0.0.5](https://prrvchr.github.io/oneDriveOOo#historical)

## Introduction:

**oneDriveOOo** is a [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/) and/or [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html) extension allowing to offer you innovative services in these office suites.  
This extension allows you to work in LibreOffice / OpenOffice on your Microsoft OneDrive files, even while offline.

Being free software I encourage you:
- To duplicate its [source code](https://github.com/prrvchr/oneDriveOOo).
- To make changes, corrections, improvements.

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Requirement:

oneDriveOOo uses a local Hsqldb database of version 2.5.1.  
The use of Hsqldb requires the installation and configuration within  
LibreOffice / OpenOffice of a **JRE version 1.8 minimum** (ie: Java version 8)

Sometimes it may be necessary for LibreOffice users must have no Hsqldb driver installed with LibreOffice  
(check your Installed Application under Windows or your Packet Manager under Linux).  
It seems that version 7.x of LibreOffice has fixed this problem and is able to work with different driver version of Hsqldb simultaneously.  
OpenOffice doesn't seem to need this workaround.

## Installation:

It seems important that the file was not renamed when it was downloaded.
If necessary, rename it before installing it.

- Install [OAuth2OOo.oxt](https://github.com/prrvchr/OAuth2OOo/raw/master/OAuth2OOo.oxt) extension version 0.0.5.

You must first install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install [oneDriveOOo.oxt](https://github.com/prrvchr/oneDriveOOo/raw/master/oneDriveOOo.oxt) extension version 0.0.5.

Restart LibreOffice / OpenOffice after installation.

## Configuration:

Configure LibreOffice Open / Save dialogs (not necessary with OpenOffice):

- **For LibreOffice V5.x and before:**

In menu Tools - Options - LibreOffice - General: check use LibreOffice dialogs.

- **For LibreOffice V6.x and above:**

In menu Tools - Options - LibreOffice - Advanced - Open Expert Configuration

Search for: UseSystemFileDialog (Found under: org.openoffice.Office.Common > Misc)

Edit or change "true" to "false" (set it to "false")

## Use:

**Open your Microsoft OneDrive:**

In File - Open - File name enter:

- **vnd.microsoft-apps://your_account/**

or

- **vnd.microsoft-apps:///**

If you don't give your_account, you will be asked for...

After authorizing the OAuthOOo application to access your Microsoft OneDrive files, your OneDrive files should appear!!! normally  ;-)

## Has been tested with:

* LibreOffice 6.4.4.2 - Ubuntu 20.04 -  LxQt 0.14.1

* LibreOffice 7.0.0.0.alpha1 - Ubuntu 20.04 -  LxQt 0.14.1

* OpenOffice 4.1.5 x86_64 - Ubuntu 20.04 - LxQt 0.14.1

* OpenOffice 4.2.0.Build:9820 x86_64 - Ubuntu 20.04 - LxQt 0.14.1

* LibreOffice 6.1.5.2 - Raspbian 10 buster - Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

* LibreOffice 6.4.4.2 (x64) - Windows 7 SP1

I encourage you in case of problem :-(  
to create an [issue](https://github.com/prrvchr/oneDriveOOo/issues/new)  
I will try to solve it ;-)

## Historical:

### What has been done for version 0.0.5:

- Integration and use of the new Hsqldb v2.5.1 system versioning.

- Writing of a new [Replicator](https://github.com/prrvchr/oneDriveOOo/blob/master/CloudUcpOOo/python/clouducp/replicator.py) interface, launched in the background (python Thread) responsible for:

    - Perform the necessary procedures when creating a new user (initial Pull).

    - Carry out pulls regularly (every ten minutes) in order to synchronize any external changes (Pull all changes).

    - Replicate on demand all changes to the hsqldb 2.5.1 database using system versioning (Push all changes).

- Writing of a new [DataBase](https://github.com/prrvchr/oneDriveOOo/blob/master/CloudUcpOOo/python/clouducp/database.py) interface, responsible for making all calls to the database.

- Setting up a cache on the Identifiers, see method: [getIdentifier()](https://github.com/prrvchr/oneDriveOOo/blob/master/CloudUcpOOo/python/clouducp/datasource.py), allowing access to a Content (file or folder) without access to the database for subsequent calls.

- Management of duplicate file/folder names by [SQL Views](https://github.com/prrvchr/oneDriveOOo/blob/master/CloudUcpOOo/python/clouducp/dbqueries.py): Child, Twin, Uri, and Title generating unique names if duplicates names exist.  
Although this functionality is only needed for gDriveOOo, it is implemented globally...

- Many other fix...

### What remains to be done for version 0.0.5:

- Write the implementation Pull Change in the new [Replicator](https://github.com/prrvchr/oneDriveOOo/blob/master/CloudUcpOOo/python/clouducp/replicator.py) interface.

- Add new language for internationalization...

- Anything welcome...
